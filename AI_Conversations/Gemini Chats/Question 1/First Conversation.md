### User Prompt 1

Consider an ensemble of stationary atoms in the ground J = 1 state, in the absence
of external fields. The atoms are optically pumped with monochromatic light propagating along z,
which is linearly polarized along x. The excited state has angular momentum J = 0 and it decays
spontaneously back to the ground state. There is no other relaxation in the system other than
this spontaneous decay. Initially, the ground state is unpolarized, so that the population is equally
distributed among the ground-state sublevels.
Assuming that the initial population of each of the ground-state Zeeman sublevels is 1/3, what
are the populations after optical pumping is complete?

---

### Gemini's Answer 1

Okay, let's break down the populations of the ground-state Zeeman sublevels after optical pumping is complete.

**1. Understanding the States and Transitions**

* **Ground State (J=1):** This state has three Zeeman sublevels, corresponding to the magnetic quantum numbers $m_J = -1, 0, +1$. Initially, each of these sublevels has a population of 1/3.
* **Excited State (J'=0):** This state has only one sublevel, $m_{J'} = 0$.
* **Optical Pumping:** The atoms are pumped with monochromatic light propagating along the z-axis and linearly polarized along the x-axis.
* **Spontaneous Decay:** The excited state ($J'=0, m_{J'}=0$) decays spontaneously back to the ground state sublevels ($J=1, m_J = -1, 0, +1$).

**2. Selection Rules for Absorption (Linearly Polarized Light)**

Light linearly polarized along the x-axis can be considered a superposition of $\sigma^+$ (circularly polarized, $\Delta m_J = +1$) and $\sigma^-$ (circularly polarized, $\Delta m_J = -1$) light when the quantization axis is chosen along x. However, it's often more straightforward to use the selection rules for linearly polarized light directly.

When the light is linearly polarized along x and propagates along z, the electric field vector is $\vec{E} = E_0 \hat{x} \cos(kz - \omega t)$. The interaction Hamiltonian involves the dipole operator $\vec{d} \cdot \vec{E}$. The x-component of the dipole operator, $d_x$, induces transitions with $\Delta m_J = \pm 1$.

* **Transition from $m_J = -1$ to $m_{J'} = 0$:** This transition is allowed ($\Delta m_J = +1$).
* **Transition from $m_J = 0$ to $m_{J'} = 0$:** This transition is **not allowed** for light linearly polarized along x and propagating along z when the quantization axis is z. For light linearly polarized along x (or y), the selection rule is $\Delta m_J = \pm 1$. For light linearly polarized along z (Ï€-polarized), the selection rule is $\Delta m_J = 0$. Since our light is polarized along x, the $m_J=0 \rightarrow m_{J'}=0$ transition will not be driven.
* **Transition from $m_J = +1$ to $m_{J'} = 0$:** This transition is allowed ($\Delta m_J = -1$).

**3. Selection Rules for Spontaneous Emission**

When the atom decays spontaneously from the excited state ($J'=0, m_{J'}=0$) to the ground state ($J=1$), the selection rules for dipole transitions are:
$\Delta J = 0, \pm 1$ (but $J=0 \leftrightarrow J=0$ is forbidden). Here $\Delta J = -1$, which is allowed.
$\Delta m_J = 0, \pm 1$.

So, from $m_{J'}=0$, the possible decay paths are:
* To $m_J = -1$
* To $m_J = 0$
* To $m_J = +1$

The probabilities (Clebsch-Gordan coefficients squared) for these decay paths are equal because the decay is isotropic in the absence of external fields from a $J'=0$ state. Since there are three possible final $m_J$ states, each will have a relative probability of 1/3 for an atom decaying from the $m_{J'}=0$ state.

**4. The Pumping Process and Steady State**

Let $N_{-1}$, $N_0$, and $N_{+1}$ be the populations of the $m_J = -1, 0, +1$ ground state sublevels, respectively.
Let $R$ be the pumping rate for the allowed transitions.

* **Atoms in $m_J = -1$:** These atoms can be excited to $m_{J'} = 0$. The rate of pumping out of $m_J = -1$ is $R \cdot N_{-1}$.
* **Atoms in $m_J = +1$:** These atoms can be excited to $m_{J'} = 0$. The rate of pumping out of $m_J = +1$ is $R \cdot N_{+1}$.
* **Atoms in $m_J = 0$:** These atoms **cannot** be excited by the x-polarized light. This is a crucial point. The $m_J=0$ state is a "dark state" for this specific polarization.

**Dynamics:**

1.  Initially: $N_{-1} = N_0 = N_{+1} = 1/3$.
2.  The pumping light excites atoms from $m_J = -1$ and $m_J = +1$ to the $m_{J'} = 0$ state.
3.  Atoms in the $m_{J'} = 0$ state decay spontaneously and equally to $m_J = -1, 0, +1$.
    * For every 3 atoms excited from $m_J=-1$ and $m_J=+1$ (total of 6 atoms if populations were equal and stayed that way, but populations change), they will eventually decay. If an atom is pumped from $m_J=-1$ to $m_{J'}=0$, it has a 1/3 chance of returning to $m_J=-1$, a 1/3 chance to $m_J=0$, and a 1/3 chance to $m_J=+1$. The same applies to atoms pumped from $m_J=+1$.

**Reaching Steady State:**

Optical pumping will continue to move atoms out of the $m_J = -1$ and $m_J = +1$ states.
When an atom is pumped from $m_J = -1$ to $m_{J'} = 0$, it then decays.
* 1/3 of the time, it returns to $m_J = -1$.
* 1/3 of the time, it goes to $m_J = 0$.
* 1/3 of the time, it goes to $m_J = +1$.

Similarly, when an atom is pumped from $m_J = +1$ to $m_{J'} = 0$:
* 1/3 of the time, it goes to $m_J = -1$.
* 1/3 of the time, it goes to $m_J = 0$.
* 1/3 of the time, it returns to $m_J = +1$.

The key is that atoms in the $m_J = 0$ state cannot absorb the x-polarized light. Therefore, any atom that decays into the $m_J = 0$ state becomes "trapped" there, as it cannot be re-excited by the incident light.

Over time, the populations of $m_J = -1$ and $m_J = +1$ will be depleted because atoms are continuously pumped out of them. Although some atoms decay back into these states, a fraction (1/3 of those excited) always decays into the $m_J = 0$ state. Since there is no way out of $m_J=0$ via optical pumping, eventually, all atoms will accumulate in this dark state.

**Therefore, after optical pumping is complete (i.e., the system has reached a steady state under continuous pumping):**

* The population of the $m_J = -1$ sublevel will be **0**.
* The population of the $m_J = 0$ sublevel will be **1** (all atoms accumulate here).
* The population of the $m_J = +1$ sublevel will be **0**.

**Detailed Justification with Rate Equations (Conceptual):**

Let $P_{-1}, P_0, P_{+1}$ be the populations of the ground state sublevels $m_J = -1, 0, +1$ respectively. Let $P_e$ be the population of the excited state $m_{J'}=0$. Let $\Gamma$ be the spontaneous decay rate from the excited state.

The rate equations would look something like this:

$\frac{dP_{-1}}{dt} = -R \cdot P_{-1} + \frac{1}{3}\Gamma P_e$
$\frac{dP_{0}}{dt} = \frac{1}{3}\Gamma P_e$ (No pumping out of $P_0$)
$\frac{dP_{+1}}{dt} = -R \cdot P_{+1} + \frac{1}{3}\Gamma P_e$
$\frac{dP_{e}}{dt} = R \cdot P_{-1} + R \cdot P_{+1} - \Gamma P_e$

And the total population is conserved: $P_{-1} + P_0 + P_{+1} + P_e = 1$.
In steady state, $\frac{dP_i}{dt} = 0$ for all $i$, and we assume $P_e \approx 0$ because spontaneous emission is usually much faster than pumping for achieving steady-state ground level populations (i.e., atoms don't spend much time in the excited state).

If $P_e \approx 0$ in steady state (meaning atoms that are excited decay very quickly), then from the excited state equation:
$R \cdot P_{-1} + R \cdot P_{+1} \approx \Gamma P_e$

From the equations for $P_{-1}$ and $P_{+1}$:
$-R \cdot P_{-1} + \frac{1}{3}\Gamma P_e = 0 \implies 3R \cdot P_{-1} = \Gamma P_e$
$-R \cdot P_{+1} + \frac{1}{3}\Gamma P_e = 0 \implies 3R \cdot P_{+1} = \Gamma P_e$

This implies that in steady state (if $P_e$ is not identically zero but a small constant), $P_{-1} = P_{+1}$.
Then $\Gamma P_e = 2 R P_{-1}$.

Substituting back into the equation for $P_{-1}$:
$-R \cdot P_{-1} + \frac{1}{3} (2 R P_{-1}) = 0$
$-R \cdot P_{-1} + \frac{2}{3} R P_{-1} = 0$
$-\frac{1}{3} R P_{-1} = 0$

This equation implies that $P_{-1} = 0$ (assuming $R \neq 0$).
Since $P_{-1} = P_{+1}$, then $P_{+1} = 0$.

If $P_{-1}=0$ and $P_{+1}=0$, then from $\Gamma P_e = R \cdot P_{-1} + R \cdot P_{+1}$, we get $\Gamma P_e = 0$, which means $P_e = 0$ (since $\Gamma \neq 0$).

From the equation for $P_0$:
$\frac{dP_{0}}{dt} = \frac{1}{3}\Gamma P_e = 0$. This doesn't mean $P_0=0$, but that its rate of change due to atoms *entering from* the excited state is zero once $P_e=0$.

The key is that the pumping mechanism actively depletes $P_{-1}$ and $P_{+1}$ by moving them to the excited state, from which they can fall into $P_0$. Once in $P_0$, they are no longer pumped. This process continues until $P_{-1}$ and $P_{+1}$ are empty.

Because the total population must be conserved ($P_{-1} + P_0 + P_{+1} = 1$, neglecting $P_e$ which is transient and small in the context of ground state populations), if $P_{-1}=0$ and $P_{+1}=0$, then $P_0=1$.

**Conclusion**

After optical pumping is complete, the populations of the ground-state Zeeman sublevels are:
* **$m_J = -1$: Population = 0**
* **$m_J = 0$: Population = 1**
* **$m_J = +1$: Population = 0**

The system becomes fully polarized into the $m_J = 0$ sublevel, which is a dark state for the given optical pumping scheme.

### User Prompt 2

Do not neglect the ground state coherences

---

### Gemini's Answer 2

When considering an ensemble of stationary atoms and not neglecting ground state coherences, the problem requires a density matrix approach, and the phenomenon of Coherent Population Trapping (CPT) becomes central.

**1. States and Transitions**

* **Ground State (J=1):** Sublevels $|g_{-1}\rangle, |g_0\rangle, |g_{+1}\rangle$ (representing $m_J = -1, 0, +1$).
    Initial state: $\rho_{gg}(0) = \frac{1}{3}(|g_{-1}\rangle\langle g_{-1}| + |g_0\rangle\langle g_0| + |g_{+1}\rangle\langle g_{+1}|)$. All populations are 1/3, and all ground-state coherences ($\rho_{mk}^{(g)}$ for $m \neq k$) are initially zero.
* **Excited State (J'=0):** Sublevel $|e_0\rangle$ (representing $m_{J'}=0$).
* **Pumping Light:** Monochromatic, along z-axis, linearly polarized along x-axis.
    The electric field is $\vec{E} = E_x \hat{x}$. The interaction Hamiltonian is $H_{int} = -d_x E_x$.
    The x-component of the dipole operator, $d_x$, can be written in terms of spherical tensor components $d_q$ as $d_x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(d_{-1} - d_{+1})$. (Note: different conventions for the sign/factor exist, but the relative phase between the $d_{+1}$ and $d_{-1}$ components is key).
    This operator couples ground states to the excited state:
    * $|g_{-1}\rangle \leftrightarrow |e_0\rangle$: via the $d_{+1}$ component of $d_x$. The matrix element is $\langle e_0 | d_x | g_{-1} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\langle e_0 | d_{-1} | g_{-1} \rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\langle e_0 | d_{+1} | g_{-1} \rangle$. For $J=1 \leftrightarrow J'=0$, $\langle e_0 | d_q | g_m \rangle \neq 0$ if $m+q=0$. So, $d_{+1}$ couples $|g_{-1}\rangle$ to $|e_0\rangle$. Let $\langle e_0 | d_x | g_{-1} \rangle = V_{-1}$.
    * $|g_{+1}\rangle \leftrightarrow |e_0\rangle$: via the $d_{-1}$ component of $d_x$. Let $\langle e_0 | d_x | g_{+1} \rangle = V_{+1}$.
    * $|g_0\rangle \leftrightarrow |e_0\rangle$: $d_x$ causes $\Delta m_J = \pm 1$ transitions. Thus, $\langle e_0 | d_x | g_0 \rangle = 0$. The state $|g_0\rangle$ is not coupled to $|e_0\rangle$ by the x-polarized light.

    The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for $J=1, m_J \to J'=0, m_{J'}=0$ with $d_x$ (which behaves as a $q=\pm 1$ mixture) imply that $V_{-1}$ and $V_{+1}$ are non-zero. Specifically, due to the structure of $d_x = (d_{-1}-d_{+1})/\sqrt{2}$ (or $d_x \propto (T_{1,+1} - T_{1,-1})$):
    $\langle e_0 | d_x | g_{-1} \rangle \propto \langle 0,0 | d_{+1} | 1,-1 \rangle$
    $\langle e_0 | d_x | g_{+1} \rangle \propto -\langle 0,0 | d_{-1} | 1,+1 \rangle$
    Since $\langle 0,0 | d_q | 1,-q \rangle$ are equal for $q=\pm 1$ (up to a common factor from the reduced matrix element), we have $V_{-1} = -V_{+1}$ (or $V_{+1} = -V_{-1}$). Let $V_{+1} = \Omega_L E_0$ (where $\Omega_L$ contains matrix elements and field amplitude), then $V_{-1} = -\Omega_L E_0$.

* **Spontaneous Decay:** Atoms in $|e_0\rangle$ decay spontaneously to $|g_{-1}\rangle, |g_0\rangle, |g_{+1}\rangle$ with equal probability (1/3 each) since $J'=0$ decays isotropically to the $J=1$ sublevels. Total decay rate is $\Gamma$.

**2. Dark States and Coherent Population Trapping**

A ground state superposition $|\psi_g\rangle = c_{-1}|g_{-1}\rangle + c_0|g_0\rangle + c_{+1}|g_{+1}\rangle$ is "dark" if it is not coupled to the excited state by the light, i.e., $\langle e_0|H_{int}|\psi_g\rangle = 0$.
$\langle e_0|H_{int}|\psi_g\rangle = c_{-1} V_{-1} + c_0 \cdot 0 + c_{+1} V_{+1} = c_{-1}(-\Omega_L E_0) + c_{+1}(\Omega_L E_0) = \Omega_L E_0 (c_{+1} - c_{-1})$.
For this to be zero, we need $c_{+1} - c_{-1} = 0 \implies c_{+1} = c_{-1}$.

The dark states are therefore:
1.  $|\psi_{D1}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|g_{-1}\rangle + |g_{+1}\rangle)$. Here $c_{-1}=c_{+1}=1/\sqrt{2}$, $c_0=0$.
2.  $|\psi_{D2}\rangle = |g_0\rangle$. Here $c_{-1}=c_{+1}=0$, $c_0=1$.

Any component of the ground state population that is not in these dark states will be pumped to $|e_0\rangle$ and will then decay. The state orthogonal to both $|\psi_{D1}\rangle$ and $|\psi_{D2}\rangle$ in the ground manifold is the "bright" state:
$|\psi_B\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|g_{-1}\rangle - |g_{+1}\rangle)$. This state is coupled to $|e_0\rangle$.

**3. Population Dynamics and Steady State**

Initially, the populations are $P(g_{-1})=1/3, P(g_0)=1/3, P(g_{+1})=1/3$, with no coherences.
We can express the initial state in the basis of dark and bright states:
* The population in $|g_0\rangle$ ($1/3$) is already in the dark state $|\psi_{D2}\rangle$.
* The populations in $|g_{-1}\rangle$ and $|g_{+1}\rangle$ (total $2/3$) can be decomposed:
    $|g_{-1}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi_{D1}\rangle + |\psi_B\rangle)$
    $|g_{+1}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi_{D1}\rangle - |\psi_B\rangle)$
    Since initially there are no coherences $\rho_{-1,+1}$, the initial $1/3$ population in $|g_{-1}\rangle\langle g_{-1}|$ contributes $1/6$ to the "population of $|\psi_{D1}\rangle$" and $1/6$ to the "population of $|\psi_B\rangle$".
    Similarly, the initial $1/3$ population in $|g_{+1}\rangle\langle g_{+1}|$ contributes $1/6$ to $|\psi_{D1}\rangle$ and $1/6$ to $|\psi_B\rangle$.
    So, initial effective populations:
    * $P_{D1}(0) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3$
    * $P_{D2}(0) = 1/3$ (from $P(g_0)$)
    * $P_B(0) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3$

The population $P_B(0)$ in the bright state $|\psi_B\rangle$ will be optically pumped to $|e_0\rangle$. Atoms in $|e_0\rangle$ decay:
* With probability 1/3 to $|g_0\rangle$ (i.e., to $|\psi_{D2}\rangle$).
* With probability 1/3 to $|g_{-1}\rangle$. Since $|g_{-1}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi_{D1}\rangle + |\psi_B\rangle)$, half of this decay path's population ($1/3 \cdot 1/2 = 1/6$ of the originally pumped atom) goes to $|\psi_{D1}\rangle$ and half ($1/6$) returns to $|\psi_B\rangle$.
* With probability 1/3 to $|g_{+1}\rangle$. Since $|g_{+1}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\psi_{D1}\rangle - |\psi_B\rangle)$, half of this decay path's population ($1/6$) goes to $|\psi_{D1}\rangle$ and half ($1/6$) returns to $|\psi_B\rangle$.

For each atom pumped from $|\psi_B\rangle$:
* It returns to $|\psi_B\rangle$ with total probability $1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3$.
* It goes to $|\psi_{D1}\rangle$ with total probability $1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3$.
* It goes to $|\psi_{D2}\rangle$ with total probability $1/3$.

Effectively, $2/3$ of the population pumped from $|\psi_B\rangle$ is transferred to the dark states ($|\psi_{D1}\rangle$ or $|\psi_{D2}\rangle$) per effective pumping cycle (that doesn't return to $\psi_B$). This means the population $P_B$ will eventually be depleted to zero.
The initial population $P_B(0) = 1/3$ is transferred out of $|\psi_B\rangle$. Of this, half goes to $|\psi_{D1}\rangle$ and half goes to $|\psi_{D2}\rangle$.
* Increase in $P_{D1} = P_B(0) \times (1/3) / (1/3+1/3) = (1/3) \times (1/2) = 1/6$.
* Increase in $P_{D2} = P_B(0) \times (1/3) / (1/3+1/3) = (1/3) \times (1/2) = 1/6$.

Final populations in the dark states:
* $P_{D1}(\text{final}) = P_{D1}(0) + 1/6 = 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2$.
* $P_{D2}(\text{final}) = P_{D2}(0) + 1/6 = 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2$.
* $P_B(\text{final}) = 0$.

The system reaches a steady state where all population is trapped in an incoherent mixture of the two dark states $|\psi_{D1}\rangle$ and $|\psi_{D2}\rangle$, each with probability 1/2.
The final density matrix of the ground state is:
$\rho_f^{(g)} = \frac{1}{2} |\psi_{D1}\rangle\langle\psi_{D1}| + \frac{1}{2} |\psi_{D2}\rangle\langle\psi_{D2}|$
$\rho_f^{(g)} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{1}{2}(|g_{-1}\rangle + |g_{+1}\rangle)(\langle g_{-1}| + \langle g_{+1}|) \right] + \frac{1}{2} |g_0\rangle\langle g_0|$
$\rho_f^{(g)} = \frac{1}{4} (|g_{-1}\rangle\langle g_{-1}| + |g_{+1}\rangle\langle g_{+1}| + |g_{-1}\rangle\langle g_{+1}| + |g_{+1}\rangle\langle g_{-1}|) + \frac{1}{2} |g_0\rangle\langle g_0|$

**4. Final Populations of Zeeman Sublevels**

The populations are the diagonal elements of this density matrix:
* Population of $m_J = -1$ ($P_{-1}$): $\rho_{-1,-1}^{(g)} = \langle g_{-1} | \rho_f^{(g)} | g_{-1} \rangle = 1/4$.
* Population of $m_J = 0$ ($P_0$): $\rho_{0,0}^{(g)} = \langle g_0 | \rho_f^{(g)} | g_0 \rangle = 1/2$.
* Population of $m_J = +1$ ($P_{+1}$): $\rho_{+1,+1}^{(g)} = \langle g_{+1} | \rho_f^{(g)} | g_{+1} \rangle = 1/4$.

The sum of populations is $1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1$.

**Ground State Coherences:**
The off-diagonal elements of $\rho_f^{(g)}$ represent the ground-state coherences:
* $\rho_{-1,+1}^{(g)} = \langle g_{-1} | \rho_f^{(g)} | g_{+1} \rangle = 1/4$.
* $\rho_{+1,-1}^{(g)} = \langle g_{+1} | \rho_f^{(g)} | g_{-1} \rangle = 1/4$.
* Coherences involving $m_J=0$, such as $\rho_{-1,0}^{(g)}$ and $\rho_{0,+1}^{(g)}$, are zero.

Thus, by not neglecting ground state coherences, we find that the system is driven into a state that includes a coherent superposition of the $m_J=-1$ and $m_J=+1$ sublevels.

Final Answer:
After optical pumping is complete, the populations of the ground-state Zeeman sublevels are:
* **Population of $m_J = -1$: $1/4$**
* **Population of $m_J = 0$: $1/2$**
* **Population of $m_J = +1$: $1/4$**
