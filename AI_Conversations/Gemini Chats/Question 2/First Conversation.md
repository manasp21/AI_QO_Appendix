Â 
Consider two states, A and B, with energy gap $\delta$ between them. At time $t=0$, state A is populated and state B is empty. A resonant excitation field drives the transitions between the two states. The strength of the driving field is characterized by the Rabi frequency $\Omega$. We are interested in the population of state B as a function of time for several different cases for the relaxation rates of the two states $\Gamma_A$ and $\Gamma_B$; it is assumed that the states decay into unobserved states:
- $\Gamma_A=\Gamma_B=0$
- $\Gamma_A=0;\,\,\Gamma_B\ll \Omega$
- $\Gamma_A=0;\,\,\Gamma_B\gg \Omega$
- $\Gamma_A=\Gamma_B=\Gamma\gg \Omega$

Okay, let's analyze the population of state B, denoted as $P_B(t)$, for each case. This is a classic problem in quantum optics and atomic physics, often described by the optical Bloch equations.

For a two-level system with states A and B, populations $P_A$ and $P_B$, driven by a resonant field with Rabi frequency $\Omega$, and decay rates $\Gamma_A$ and $\Gamma_B$ to unobserved states, the time evolution of the density matrix elements can be solved. We are interested in $P_B(t) = \rho_{BB}(t)$, given the initial conditions $P_A(0) = 1$ and $P_B(0) = 0$.

The energy gap $\Delta$ being resonant with the excitation field means the detuning is zero.

## Case 1: $\Gamma_A=\Gamma_B=0$ (No decay)

In this ideal case, there is no dissipation. The system undergoes coherent **Rabi oscillations**. The population of state B is given by:

$P_B(t) = \frac{\Omega^2}{2\Omega^2} (1 - \cos(\Omega t)) = \sin^2\left(\frac{\Omega t}{2}\right)$

**Description:** The population of state B oscillates sinusoidally between 0 and 1 with a frequency equal to the Rabi frequency $\Omega$. The system coherently transfers population from state A to state B and back.

---
## Case 2: $\Gamma_A=0;\,\,\Gamma_B\ll \Omega$ (Slow decay of state B)

Here, state A is stable, but state B decays slowly compared to the Rabi oscillation period. The population of state B will exhibit **damped Rabi oscillations**.

The approximate solution when $\Gamma_B \ll \Omega$ is:

$P_B(t) \approx \frac{\Omega^2}{\Omega^2 + (\Gamma_B/2)^2} e^{-\frac{\Gamma_B}{2}t} \sin^2\left(\frac{\sqrt{\Omega^2 - (\Gamma_B/2)^2}}{2} t\right)$

Given $\Gamma_B \ll \Omega$, this simplifies further to:

$P_B(t) \approx e^{-\frac{\Gamma_B}{2}t} \sin^2\left(\frac{\Omega t}{2}\right)$

**Description:** The population of state B still oscillates, but the amplitude of these oscillations decays exponentially with a rate of $\Gamma_B/2$. The oscillation frequency is approximately $\Omega$. Eventually, due to the decay of state B, the population in both A and B will go to zero (since A transfers to B, which then decays). However, if we are only considering the initial dynamics before significant decay from B occurs, we see oscillations. If the system reaches a steady state, $P_B$ would be non-zero if A was continuously repopulated, but here A is not. Over long times, $P_B(t) \to 0$.

## Case 3: $\Gamma_A=0;\,\,\Gamma_B\gg \Omega$ (Fast decay of state B)

In this scenario, state B decays very rapidly, much faster than the rate at which population is coherently driven into it by the field. This is the regime where the **quantum Zeno effect** can become prominent, though the direct expression for $P_B(t)$ is more telling of an overdamped-like behavior for population transfer.

The population of state B is approximately:

$P_B(t) \approx \frac{\Omega^2}{\Gamma_B^2} \left(1 - e^{-\Gamma_B t/2}\right)^2$
More accurately, for early times $t \ll 2/\Gamma_B$, $P_B(t) \approx (\Omega^2/\Gamma_B)t$.
However, the general behavior is an initial rise in $P_B(t)$ followed by decay. The peak population reached by state B will be small because it decays before significant population can be transferred.

A more detailed analysis shows that the system is effectively overdamped. The population transfer to state B is significantly suppressed. The rate of transfer from A to B is roughly $\Omega^2/\Gamma_B$.

$P_B(t) \approx \frac{\Omega^2}{\Gamma_B (\Gamma_B/2)} (1 - e^{-\Gamma_B t/2}) - \text{terms that ensure } P_B(0)=0 \text{ and account for coherent driving.}$

A common approximation in this limit is that the population of state B quickly reaches a small quasi-steady state value proportional to $\Omega^2/\Gamma_B^2$ and then decays if the source A depletes or the driving stops. However, with A initially populated and $\Gamma_A=0$, A will continuously try to pump B.

The population of state B can be approximated by:
$P_B(t) \approx \frac{\Omega^2}{\Gamma_B^2 + 2\Omega^2} \left(1 - e^{-\frac{(\Gamma_B^2+2\Omega^2)t}{2\Gamma_B}}\cos\left(\frac{\Omega^2 t}{\Gamma_B}\right)\right)$ (This is a complex regime to simplify generally without full Bloch equations).

A more standard result for the effective pumping rate into B and its subsequent quick decay is:
The system quickly reaches a regime where the upward pumping rate from A to B ($R_{AB}$) equals the decay rate from B ($P_B \Gamma_B$). The pumping rate $R_{AB}$ itself is suppressed by the fast decay of B (related to the quantum Zeno effect or motional narrowing in other contexts). The effective rate of transfer from A to B becomes $\approx \Omega^2/\Gamma_B$.
So, $P_A(t) \approx e^{-(\Omega^2/\Gamma_B)t}$.
And $P_B(t)$ will be such that $dP_B/dt \approx (\Omega^2/\Gamma_B)P_A(t) - \Gamma_B P_B(t)$.
Assuming $P_B(t)$ reaches a quasi-steady state quickly ($dP_B/dt \approx 0$ relative to $\Gamma_B P_B(t)$), then $P_B(t) \approx \frac{\Omega^2}{\Gamma_B^2} P_A(t) = \frac{\Omega^2}{\Gamma_B^2} e^{-(\Omega^2/\Gamma_B)t}$.

**Description:** The population of state B rises to a very small maximum value $(\approx \Omega^2/\Gamma_B^2)$ and then decays slowly. The rapid decay of state B inhibits significant population transfer; the system barely makes it to state B before decaying. This is sometimes referred to as an overdamped scenario for the population transfer. No oscillations are observed in $P_B(t)$.

## Case 4: $\Gamma_A=\Gamma_B=\Gamma\gg \Omega$ (Fast decay of both states)

Here, both states decay rapidly to unobserved states, and this decay is much faster than the Rabi frequency.

In this strong damping regime, the coherent oscillations are completely suppressed. The populations $P_A(t)$ and $P_B(t)$ will simply decay rapidly.
Since $\Gamma \gg \Omega$, any population transferred to B will quickly decay, and the population in A also decays quickly.

$P_A(t) = e^{-\Gamma t}$ (approximately, as the driving term $\Omega$ is much weaker than $\Gamma$)
$P_B(t)$ will be very small. The driving field tries to transfer population from A to B, but both states decay rapidly.
The equation for $P_B(t)$ is approximately:
$\frac{dP_B(t)}{dt} \approx \frac{\Omega}{2} (\text{coherence term}) - \Gamma P_B(t)$
The coherence itself is rapidly damped by $\Gamma$.

The population in state B will be a small transient. It will rise to a maximum value much smaller than 1 and then decay.
The rate equations in this limit become:
$\dot{\rho}_{AA} = -\Gamma_A \rho_{AA} - \frac{i\Omega}{2}(\rho_{AB} - \rho_{BA})$
$\dot{\rho}_{BB} = -\Gamma_B \rho_{BB} + \frac{i\Omega}{2}(\rho_{AB} - \rho_{BA})$
$\dot{\rho}_{AB} = -(\frac{\Gamma_A+\Gamma_B}{2}) \rho_{AB} - \frac{i\Omega}{2}(\rho_{AA} - \rho_{BB})$

Given $\Gamma_A = \Gamma_B = \Gamma \gg \Omega$:
The off-diagonal terms ($\rho_{AB}$) which drive population changes are heavily damped by $\Gamma$.
$\rho_{AB} \approx \frac{-i\Omega/2}{\Gamma} (\rho_{AA} - \rho_{BB})$ (quasi-steady state for coherence)
Substituting this into the equation for $\rho_{BB}$:
$\dot{P}_B \approx -\Gamma P_B + \frac{\Omega^2}{2\Gamma} (P_A - P_B)$
Given $P_A(0)=1, P_B(0)=0$.
Initially, $\dot{P}_B \approx \frac{\Omega^2}{2\Gamma} P_A(0) = \frac{\Omega^2}{2\Gamma}$.
So, $P_B(t) \approx \frac{\Omega^2}{2\Gamma} t$ for very short times.
However, $P_A(t)$ is also decaying as $e^{-\Gamma t}$ (primarily, ignoring the weak transfer to B).
So, $P_B(t)$ will be a small pulse. It increases initially due to pumping from A, but then decreases due to its own decay $\Gamma_B$ and the depletion of state A due to $\Gamma_A$.

A reasonable approximation for $P_B(t)$ in this limit:
The population primarily decays from state A. The transfer to B is weak.
$P_A(t) \approx e^{-\Gamma t}$
$P_B(t)$ would be a result of excitation from $P_A(t)$ and its own decay.
$\frac{dP_B}{dt} = W P_A(t) - \Gamma P_B(t)$, where $W \approx \frac{\Omega^2}{2\Gamma}$ is the incoherent pumping rate in this highly damped regime.
So, $\frac{dP_B}{dt} = \frac{\Omega^2}{2\Gamma} e^{-\Gamma t} - \Gamma P_B(t)$.
This is a linear first-order ODE.
Solving this with $P_B(0)=0$:
$P_B(t) = \frac{\Omega^2}{2\Gamma} t e^{-\Gamma t}$

**Description:** The population of state B will exhibit a small, brief pulse. It will rise to a maximum value of $P_{B,max} = \frac{\Omega^2}{2\Gamma^2 e}$ at $t=1/\Gamma$, and then decay to zero. The overall population in the system (A+B) decays rapidly with rate $\Gamma$. No oscillations are seen. The efficiency of transfer to state B is very low, proportional to $(\Omega/\Gamma)^2$.
